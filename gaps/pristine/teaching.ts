/**
 * The teaching layer: every player-facing mechanic, where the player first
 * meets it, and how the game explains it there.
 *
 * Two rules make this hold together as the game grows:
 *
 * 1. Every entry in MECHANIC_INVENTORY resolves to a teaching moment or
 *    carries a written waiver. `dev/teach-sim.ts` fails the build otherwise.
 *    A new mechanic with no line here is a red build, not a thing somebody
 *    notices six patches later.
 * 2. Teaching happens at first contact, not up front. A coachmark fires the
 *    first time its surface is actually reached, once per save slot, ever.
 *    The opening dive teaches the four verbs and nothing else.
 *
 * The Tutorial Agent owns the moments (what is taught, where, on what
 * trigger). The Narrative Director owns the words. See tutorial/ledger.md.
