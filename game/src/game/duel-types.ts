/**
 * Split-board duel model. Each side gets its OWN grid, pre-dealt with
 * scrambled connector nodes; rotating is the only movement verb. Your signal
 * runs live from your entry on the left edge through aligned arms toward the
 * goal column on the right. Light any goal cell and the dive ends.
 *
 * Two layers, and keeping them apart is the whole design:
 *
 *   BUILT — every node your signal has ever lit. Permanent. Reach walks from
 *           it, so a cut can never strand the frontier you have already made.
 *   LIVE  — every node currently carrying signal from your entry. One twist
 *           upstream and everything behind it goes dark.
 *
 * So progress is reversible in throughput but never in construction. There is
 * no territory and no claiming: the enemy is never on your board, only its
 * traps and its redirects are. You defend against those, not against ground.
 *
 * Every combatant runs the same three programs — SCAN / ATTACK / DEFEND —
 * at 1 RAM each, once per turn each. Tiers widen them, modes reshape them.
 * ATTACK reaches across to the enemy board; DEFEND acts on your own.
 *
 * Arm masks and rotation semantics live in ./types
 * (0 north, 1 east, 2 south, 3 west; bit = 1 << dir).
 *
 * Rotation is UNIDIRECTIONAL — `(rot + 1) % 4` everywhere, and `rotCostFor`
 * only searches forward. Undoing one enemy twist therefore costs 3 RAM on an
 * elbow or T and 1 on a straight. That asymmetry is what makes reaching over
 * to their board worth the RAM, and the reason no hold-the-goal phase exists.
